        Endaoment brings the power of MolochDAO into the DeFi age.
      </div>
      <div class="q-mb-md">
        Like Moloch, Endaoment enables digital communities to pool and disperse capital to fund important public goods they believe in.
      </div>
      <div class="q-mb-md">
        Endaoment leverages the same basic mechanics and incentive structures that has worked well for MolochDAO, MetaCartel, and many others. This includes members offering tribute to join and rage-quitting with their share of the funds if a proposal is passed they strongly disagree with.
      </div>
      <div class="q-mb-md">
        Unlike Moloch, Endaoment leverages modern DeFi primitives to do more. Capital held in an Endaoment earns interest through Compound Finance. Grants made to causes are paid out via Sablier money streams, and can be revoked if the grantee isn’t holding up their part of the bargain.
      </div>
      <div class="q-mb-md">
        Our submission includes not only the Endaoment contracts, and a frontend for interacting with them, but we’ve also built a tool that let’s anyone launch their own Endaoment with a few clicks.
      </div>
      <div class="q-mb-md">
        We believe in digital localism— a world where global, internet-native communities organize to make a difference. Endaoment can be the treasury for digitally native communities.
